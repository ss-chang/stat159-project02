## LASSO Regression


```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
load(file = "../../data/regression/lasso-fit.RData")
```


The LASSO shrunk the predictors Education, Gender, Married, and Ethnicity to zero, leaving Income, Limit, Rating, Cards, Age and Student as significant predictors. The most significant predictor is Limit with a coefficient value of approximately 0.93.

```{r xtable, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
coef_table <- xtable(coef(full_data_fit))
print(coef_table, type="latex", comment = F, label = "Table 1")
```
